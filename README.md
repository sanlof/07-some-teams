# 07 - Some Teams
This is/was a student exercise, to create a simple website using the web development concepts learned so far, including HTML, CSS, and PHP. The project was also an exercise in using Git and GitHub, covering tasks like creating a repository, making commits, and version control.

The website was built according to the following instructions:
* The data you will be using is in data.php.
* Your web site should contain a start page and an about page.
* The about page should have information about you, the creator.
* The start page should be constructed with at least three different .php files, and should display the teams listed in data.php. Feel free to list them how you like.
* The project should not print any HTML within PHP strings.
* The project should not include any coding errors, warning or notices.
* The repository should have at least 7 commits and not just one big commit.
* The repository should contain a README.md file with information about the project (usually a README.md includes information about what the project is about, how it's made, about the author, install instructions if any and such stuff)
* The repository should contain a LICENSE file. Preferably MIT.

## The finished result
The website has been published online (2024-10-01) and can be found at [sanlof.se](https://sanlof.se/07-some-teams/).
